# RMC Mini MVCS

Mini MVCS is a custom Unity library framework embracing the [MVCS architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).

- One of many solutions for organizing a Unity project efficiently. It may or may not be the best solution for you.
- Features few classes and a flexible pattern. Following the conventions of MVCS requires discipline as the system is purposefully light and flexible. For example the a model instance can access another model instance, but it is recommended not to do so.
- A library has no requirement on **non-MonoBehaviour**. Using MonoBehaviours is optional.
